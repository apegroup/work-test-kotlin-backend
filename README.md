# Backend Engineer – Technical Assessment

Thank you for your interest in joining **Eidra**.

This technical assessment is designed to give us a foundation for a technical discussion during the interview process. It is not intended to be a pass/fail coding test, nor a production‑ready implementation.

We are interested in how you reason about backend problems, make trade‑offs, and communicate technical decisions.

---

## Overview

You will build a small backend service in **Kotlin (JVM)**, preferably using **Ktor**.

The scope is intentionally limited and should take approximately **2–3 hours** to complete.

The code you submit will be used as the basis for a **code review discussion**.

---

## Problem Statement

You are helping a client launch a new API‑based product.

To protect the service and prepare for future billing models, the client needs a way to **track and enforce API usage quotas per customer**.

Your task is to build a backend service that acts as an **API Usage & Quota Service**.

This service is responsible only for tracking usage and enforcing quotas.  
There is no downstream business API to implement.

---

## Behavior

Each API key has a usage quota, for example: 100 units per hour.

When a request is received:
- If enough quota remains, the request is accepted (200 OK)
- If the quota would be exceeded, the request is rejected (429 Too Many Requests or similar)
- Usage quotas automatically reset after the configured time window.
- API keys must be tracked independently.
- The service must behave correctly under concurrent requests.
- Invalid input (e.g. negative units, missing headers) should be handled gracefully.


## Constraints

The following constraints are intentional and reflect an MVP client delivery:

- Single service instance
- In‑memory storage is acceptable
- No database or external cache is required
- No authentication beyond the API key
- No frontend or UI

## Optional Considerations

You may choose to implement or simply reason about any of the following:

- Fixed vs. sliding time windows
- Returning remaining quota information in responses
- Logging or basic metrics
- Unit, integration, or API‑level tests
- Clock abstraction or time handling strategies
- Choosing what not to implement is part of the exercise.

## What We’re Looking For

We will use this submission as the basis for a technical discussion.

We are interested in:

- Clear, readable, and maintainable code
- Sensible abstractions without over‑engineering
- Thoughtful trade‑offs within the given constraints
- Awareness of concurrency and time‑based logic
- Understanding of testing strategies (unit, integration, end‑to‑end)

We are not looking for:
- A perfect or fully production‑ready solution
- Extensive infrastructure or frameworks
- Premature optimization or scalability

## Deliverables

Please provide:

- A working backend service implemented in Kotlin
- A short README section describing:
  - Your design choices
  - Trade‑offs made for this MVP
  - What you would change or add for a larger or higher‑traffic system
  - (Optional) Tests or example requests

## Code Review

Once this has been completed you will be scheduled for a discussion where you will walk us through your solution, explaining:

- What the code does
- Why you structured it the way you did
- What assumptions or limitations exist
- What risks or improvements you would highlight to a client

## Final Notes

This assessment is intended to support a technical conversation, not to evaluate how much you can build in a limited time.
We value clear reasoning, smart decision‑making, and thoughtful communication.
Thank you for taking the time to complete this exercise — we look forward to discussing it with you!
